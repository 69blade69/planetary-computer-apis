# Support

This repository contains the code for Planetary Computer APIs and example deployment of those components into Azure. It is meant to serve as a reference implementation for combining various open source libraries into a set of services that deploy on Azure. As this is a reference implementation and not not intended to be libraries or tools for others to run, users utilizing the code in this repository do so at their own risk, without an expectation of support. Feel free to file Issues for problems specifically with the APIs contained in this repository, with the understanding that there is no guarantee that issues in this repository will be addressed, particularly if the issues pertain to an external utilization of this code.

## Microsoft Support Policy
